# Will-It-Fly
### Flight Delay Prediction Application

- **Developed an application** to predict flight delays using machine learning and exploratory data analysis.

#### Data Collection and Preparation
- Sourced flight data from multiple APIs and created a comprehensive DataFrame using Python and Pandas.
- Performed extensive data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

#### Feature Engineering
- Conducted thorough feature engineering to extract relevant features from raw data, including weather conditions, flight schedules, and historical delays, to improve model accuracy.

#### Model Development and Optimization
- Built and trained multiple machine learning models to predict flight delays.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters using cross-validation and grid search techniques to optimize model performance, achieving a ROC-AUC score of 0.8.

#### Deployment and Application Development
- Integrated the final model into a user-friendly application, providing real-time predictions of flight delays based on input parameters.
